Welcome to my (somewhat austere) personal page. I'm a recent *cum laude* graduate
of **Northeastern University**, with a B.S. in **computer science** and a **linguistics** minor.

I'm a big fan of **cycling** as a serious mode of transit and the infrastructure that goes along with it. I'm also working on my cooking skills. One time, I even made a ***frittata***! Last but not least among my fascinating hobbies is my **exotic houseplant** collection. It's limited by the amount of free space available for now, but as soon as I get more space I plan on becoming the plant equivalent of a **crazy cat lady**.
